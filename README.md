## Procedures
The implementation of the Flashcards and Quiz Application project followed a systematic and detailed approach, adhering to the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD). The project setup involved creating a Java application managed by Maven, where dependencies for JUnit (for unit testing) and JSON handling were configured in the `pom.xml` file. This configuration ensured that all necessary libraries and tools were available for both development and testing phases, creating a robust foundation for the project.

The project directory was organized with separate folders for source code (`src/main/java`), resources (`src/main/resources`), and test cases (`src/test/java`). This organization facilitated a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to manage different parts of the application independently. The source code directory housed the main application logic, the resources directory contained the JSON files with flashcards and quiz data, and the test directory was used for writing and organizing unit tests.

The development process began with writing failing test cases for core functionalities, in line with TDD principles. Initial tests focused on basic operations such as loading flashcards from a JSON file and ensuring the data was parsed correctly. This phase involved creating mock JSON files and writing tests to validate that the application could read and process these files accurately. The tests were designed to fail initially, highlighting the gaps in functionality that needed to be addressed.

Following the initial tests, corresponding code was implemented to make these tests pass. This included developing methods for reading JSON files using classes like `DatabaseJson` and `JsonUtils`, parsing the data into appropriate structures, and storing it for later use. Each piece of functionality was developed incrementally, with tests guiding the implementation. As each test passed, confidence in the correctness of the implementation grew, laying a solid groundwork for further development.

Once basic functionalities were established, additional features were incrementally added. For instance, functionalities for handling quiz data, managing user interactions, and providing detailed feedback were implemented. The `QuizData` class was developed to handle loading and managing quiz questions from JSON files. This class organized questions into categories and ensured that they could be retrieved and displayed correctly. Each new feature was accompanied by corresponding tests to ensure its correctness, maintaining the TDD cycle.

The graphical user interface (GUI) was developed using Swing, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface. Components such as `JFrame`, `JButton`, `JTextArea`, and `JPanel` were utilized to create various parts of the application, including the main window, flashcard display, and quiz interfaces. The GUI development followed the TDD approach, with tests written for each component to validate its behavior. For instance, tests ensured that buttons triggered the correct actions and that text areas displayed the expected information.

Comprehensive error handling mechanisms were implemented to manage potential issues such as file read/write errors, incorrect data formats, and user input errors. These mechanisms were crucial for ensuring the application could handle unexpected situations gracefully. For example, if a JSON file was missing or malformed, the application would display a clear error message to the user instead of crashing. This level of robustness was achieved by writing tests that simulated various error conditions and ensuring the application responded appropriately.

The application integrated with JSON files to manage flashcards and quiz data. Utility classes such as `JsonUtils` and `DatabaseJson` were developed to handle JSON reading and writing operations, ensuring data integrity and ease of updates. These classes provided methods for reading JSON data from files, writing updated data back to files, and ensuring that files existed and were properly formatted. The use of JSON as a data format provided flexibility and ease of use, allowing for straightforward updates and additions to the data.

Additionally, a command-line interface was provided to allow users to input expressions directly. This interface supported expressions with or without space separation between characters and operators, enhancing the application's usability. The command-line interface was particularly useful for advanced users who preferred a text-based interaction model. It was developed with the same attention to detail and tested thoroughly to ensure it functioned correctly.

Extensive unit tests were written to validate each aspect of the application's functionality. Tests were organized by component and covered various scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage. For instance, tests for the `DatabaseJson` class verified that flashcards were loaded correctly from JSON files, while tests for the `QuizData` class ensured that quiz questions were correctly categorized and retrieved. Integration tests were performed to validate the interactions between different components, ensuring that the system as a whole functioned correctly and met the specified requirements.

Regression tests were conducted after each major change to ensure that new code did not introduce any regressions, helping maintain the stability and reliability of the application. This process involved re-running all existing tests after each significant update to the codebase, ensuring that previously working functionality remained intact. The project leveraged automated testing tools to run tests frequently and efficiently, facilitating early detection of issues and streamlining the development process.

By following these procedures, the Flashcards and Quiz Application project successfully achieved its objectives, demonstrating robustness, accuracy, and user-friendliness. The systematic application of TDD principles ensured that the code was thoroughly tested and maintained high standards of quality throughout the development process.
